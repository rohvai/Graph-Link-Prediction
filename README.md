# Graph-Link-Prediction
We are given a directed graph in which each node represents a user in a large social network. A directed edge from some user 'x' to a user 'y' 
indicates that user x follows user y.
The task is to predict the presence of an edge between two random users in the social network. This problem is similar to the friend recommender system of facebook in which facebook recommends the people we may know.
